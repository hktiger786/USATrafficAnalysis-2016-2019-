# USA_TrafficAnalysis(2015-2019)
The scope of this project primarily covers US traffic data along with accident reports from the years 2015 to 2019 with an overall size of the dataset around 13 million.The  goal is to find trends in the traffic and accident data and observe if there are any correlations between a personâ€™s driving habits and their environment and socio-economic background. Environmental factors assessed were weather records, storm patterns, and air pollution levels from greenhouse gas emissions.Certain socio-economic factors such as education, income, poverty, and unemployment were also evaluated.

After the integration of data from various websites were able to divide the data into five tables. North Carolina has the most amount of traffic accidents as compared to other states. On further analysis it was found that NC had a lot of storms during the period of 2015-2019 which lead to increase in the number of accidents.
